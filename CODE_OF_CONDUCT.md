# Popup Maker Code of Conduct

Like the community as a whole, the Popup Maker team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to the Popup Maker team, contributors, and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.
